                Shanley Mae Sebial</b> (Japanese: シャンリー・メイ・セビアル  <a href="Shanley.html">Shanley Mae Sebial</a>, born 24 May 2004, in Osaka Prefecture) is a Japanese-French 
                hybrid and self-proclaimed 'zombie alien.' Currently, she is a spy and infiltrating the school, Cebu Institute of Technology - University in Cebu, malamangz. 
                Shanley finds herself in a peculiar situation, experiencing a great time at school but facing challenges when it comes to school activities. Shanley has an insatiable 
                love for exploration and adventure.<br/><br/></div>

            <div class="content">In the far reaches of the galaxy, where baguettes float and sushi orbits, a legend was born.<br/><br/>
                 On that fateful day, May 24, 2004, in the heart of Osaka Prefecture, <a href="Shanley.html">Shanley Mae Sebial</a>, a Japanese-French hybrid zombie alien, made her grand entrance into the universe. <br/><br/>
                Shanley's early life was a whirlwind of cosmic hilarity. Her parents, hailing from Japan and France, couldn't decide whether to put soy sauce or garlic butter on her baby formula. At an early age, Shanley developed an uncanny ability to order sushi in fluent French. 
                Her pacifier was more of a ray gun than a soothing tool, and her baby babbles sounded like interstellar Morse code.<br/><br/>
                But the real twist in the tale was when young Shanley stumbled upon an old spaceship while playing in the backyard. Little did she know, this would be her ticket to her future as a zombie alien. 
                The spaceship, buried beneath the flowerbeds, was a cosmic relic, a relic that tickled her curiosity and transformed her into the galaxy's first undead interstellar traveler.<br/><br/>
                Now, as she ventured into the realm of Earth education, she excelled at confusing teachers with her zombie-like resilience to sleep during long lectures. Her notebooks were filled with out-of-this-world doodles, 
                and she took 'French zombie alien' to a whole new level. Her friends never knew what to expect when they came over for playdates. It was either alien laser tag in the living room or a gourmet fusion dinner with 
                dishes like 'sushi au gratin' and 'croissant maki rolls.'<br/><br/>
                <a href="Shanley.html">Shanley Mae Sebial</a>'s early years were a comic strip of extraterrestrial hilarity, blending the quirkiest aspects of Japanese, French, and zombie culture into one delightful, bewildering package. 
                Little did she know that her peculiar beginnings would shape her into the charming, cosmic adventurer she is today.<br/><br/></div>
